Magicraft: The Gathering

This mod is an attempt to create a Magic: The Gathering-like game for Minecraft. Like MTG the players use different coloured mana to cast spells and summon creatures in order to kill the other player/s.

Due to the differences between the turn-based MTG and the real-time Minecraft environment there will be restrictions on what can be implemented in the mod. So far:
 - counterspells will not be included,
 - there is no practical difference between Instants and Sorceries (as there are no turns).

So far this is very bare bones, with only basic summoning implemented. Help with the graphical aspects (i.e.  creating new creature models/animations, and other visual effects) would be very much appreciated.
