Magicraft: the Gathering

This mod is an attempt to create a Magic: the Gathering-like game for Minecraft. Like MTG the players use different coloured mana to cast spells and summon creatures in order to kill the other player/s.

So far this is very bare bones, with only basic summoning implemented. Help with the graphical aspects (i.e.  creating new creature models/animations, and other visual effects) would be very much appreciated.
